Q1: We save bits 20-16 and 15-11 of the instruction because we do not know 
which of these bits we would use to decide the writeback register. We would 
have to wait till the EX stage when the instruction decode is completed to 
figure this out. It is a waste of space to save the whole instruction. We could
achieved the same effects by saving the control signals.

Q2:
- EX: 
We need to use ALUSrc, ALUOp, and RegDst immediately in the EX stage, and we do
not need to use them later in other stages. Therefore, they are EX signals.
- M:
We do not need to use MemWrite, MemRead or Brach signals until the MEM stage, 
and we need to save them till the MEM stage. Therefore, they are MEM signals.
- WB:
We do not need to use MemtoReg or RegWrite signals until the WB stage, and we
need to save them till the WB stage. Therefore, they are WB signals.
