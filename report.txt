Q1: We save bits 20-16 and 15-11 of the instruction because we do not know 
which of these bits we would use to decide the writeback register. We would 
have to wait till the EX stage when the instruction decode is completed to 
figure this out. It is a waste of space to save the whole instruction. We could
achieved the same effects by saving the control signals.
